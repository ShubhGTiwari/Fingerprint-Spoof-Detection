# Fingerprint Spoof Detector Based on LBP and HOG

## Abstract :
Fake fingers can be easily fabricated using commonly available materials,
such as latex, silicone, and gelatin, with the fingerprint ridges of an individual engraved
on them. These fake fingers can then be used by an adversary to launch a spoof attack
by placing them on a fingerprint sensor and claiming the identity of another individual.
The success rate of such spoof attacks can be up to 70%. Fingerprint spoof detection
algorithms have been proposed as a countermeasure against spoof attacks. A
fingerprint spoof detector is a pattern classifier used to distinguish a live finger from a
fake (spoof) one in the context of an automated fingerprint recognition system. Most
liveness detectors are learning-based and rely on a set of training images. Project Goal:
To develop a two-class fingerprint spoof detector that uses Local Binary Patterns (LBP)
and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features along with ML classification
algorithms to distinguish live fingerprint images from spoof samples.s
